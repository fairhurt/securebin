# securebin

securebin is a Google Chrome extension for interfacing securely with PasteBin.

Users can encrypt plaintext and have it stored onto PasteBin, where they can copy the link and key to send it to another user for decryption.

First, users will need to get a API key from PasteBin to be able to post onto PasteBin. [PasteBin Doc](https://pastebin.com/doc_api#1)

Once the API key is added to the extension in the settings page, users can post their messages securely to PasteBin.
